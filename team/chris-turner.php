		<p class="name">A. Chris Turner</p>

		<p class="title">SEO Specialist <br/>Founder, Chocolate SEO</p>

		<p class="bio">As the founder of Chocolate SEO, an SEO/SEM consulting service, Chris Turner knows a thing or two about maximizing search visibility. He’s dedicated nearly 10 years to identifying and tackling search marketing strategies while working for several prestigious advertising and digital agencies throughout the Southeast. And it’s this focus that makes him an integral member of the Ready Set Go team. But let’s be honest. His vast superhero knowledge, infectious laugh, and spectacular taste in music don’t hurt either.</p>

		<p class="bio">Whether it’s solving problems, teaching others, or gathering and interpreting data, Chris is passionate about learning and educating others. He says the only way to truly help clients score touchdowns and reach their goals is to make them part of their digital marketing plans so they can understand exactly what’s going on.</p>

		<p class="bio bonus">Did you know: As a child, Chris wanted to be a professional football player—which is why we used words such as “tackle,” “touchdown,” and “score” in his bio. We thought it might appease his unmet adolescent dream. Hope it worked.</p>
