		<p class="name">Tony Dancy</p>

		<p class="title">Film &amp; Video Production <br/>Co-Owner, tell-tale Media</p>

		<p class="bio">Tony Dancy is a man of exceptional talent. Yes, he’s an award-winning filmmaker. But he’s also an amazing scriptwriter, cameraman, director, producer, editor, and audio mixer. </p>

		<p class="bio">Relying on his more than 18 years of professional experience, Tony has a natural ability for understanding exactly what clients have in mind. He listens to their goals, ideas, and, most important, the passion behind their words. He then translates these elements into compelling visual stories that blow away clients’ expectations. He says the moment when he figures out the perfect way to tell a client’s story is “a rush like none other.” </p>

		<p class="bio">Filmmaking is a collaborative art form, which complements Tony’s outgoing personality. He loves meeting new people and hearing their stories. And he finds great fulfillment, both professionally and personally, in being an advocate and helping others find their voices and paths to greatness.</p>

		<p class="bio">In addition to debuting films at the Nashville Film Festival, Tony co-directed, produced, and edited “Duty Of The Hour,” a feature documentary about civil rights leader Benjamin L. Hooks. His impressive client roster includes The Travel Channel, A&E, HBO, ESPN, MTV, The University of Memphis, and The State of Tennessee Treasury Department. </p>

		<p class="bio bonus">Fun Fact: Although he’s partial to jazz, there’s not a genre of music that Tony doesn’t appreciate. He’s seen Prince, Jimmy Buffett, and Phish at least five times each in concert.</p>
