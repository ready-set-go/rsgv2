		<p class="name">Katy Oss</p>

		<p class="title">Graphic Design/Video Production <br/>Co-Owner, tell-tale Media</p>

		<p class="bio">Houdini doesn’t have a thing on Katy “The Magnificent” Oss. For more than 10 years, she’s been working her magic to transform clients’ creative dreams into reality. Oh, and apparently she can fly.</p>

		<p class="bio">Seriously though, spend five minutes with Katy and you’ll adore her as much as we do. From her quirky sense of humor to her temporary heart-shaped eye patch, she’s known for her unique perspective and creative problem solving. And it’s these qualities that have made her an award-winning graphic designer and filmmaker.</p>

		<p class="bio">As co-owner of tell-tale Media, Katy has worked with everything from advertising agencies and restaurants to nonprofit organizations and mapmakers. Her work includes a documentary about civil rights leader Benjamin Hooks, which was featured at the 2015 Nashville Film Festival, and a music video for Travis Meadows, who has been called Nashville's most badass songwriter by Rolling Stone magazine. </p>

		<p class="bio">Katy loves collaborating with others to get fresh ideas and knows the importance of giving clients personal attention. In fact, she says the best part of her job is knowing her clients are happy. But her love of helping others doesn’t stop there. She volunteers with the Contributor newspaper, and she devoted six years to being a big sister with Big Brothers/Big Sisters. </p>

		<p class="bio bonus">Did You Know: In addition to winning several Addy awards for her design work, she’s the proud recipient of a "Worst Dancer" award that was was given to her during a family Christmas party. </p>
