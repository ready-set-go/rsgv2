			<p><span itemprop="name">Ready Set Go</span> is a collective of freelancers who have combined their creative talents to provide collaborative digital marketing solutions. We take a lot of pride in our work. A lot. After all, our names and reputations are on the line—so when we do something, we go for the win. </p>

			<p>And just like our setup, our entire approach to the creative process is unique. Rather than focus our work on a specific industry, service, or product, we prefer to focus on a specific type of client. That is, we specialize in working with people who aren’t afraid to rebel against tradition, who love pushing creative boundaries, and who don’t tend to use the word leverage as a verb.</p>

			<p>But we're more than creative professionals. We're also business owners and entrepreneurs who understand the responsibilities and challenges that come with owning and operating a business. </p>

			<p>So, what are you waiting for—are you in, or are you going to leverage your current resources from the sidelines?</p>

			<p>It’s simple. <br/>We want you to be so stoked about our services that you tell your friends how amazing we are. After all, you wouldn’t put your stamp of approval on just anything, <br/>right?</p>

					<article id="bio">
						
						<p class="bio">After coming to terms that her chances of becoming a professional tuba player weren’t stacked in her favor, Lindsey Maddox channeled her creative spirit into the world of graphic design and digital development—where she’s spent the last 10 years developing the you-know-what out of websites. </p>

						<p class="bio">Lindsey will be the first to tell you that consistency is key when it comes to effective digital messaging. That’s why she ensures every website she creates accurately reflects a client’s brand and voice. A self-proclaimed stickler for industry standards and best practices, she relies on her background in art and graphic design to hand-code pixel-perfect, fluidly responsive websites.</p>

						<p class="bio">She also has a flair for developing clean, solid, semantic markup and loves getting deep into coding and finding solutions to even the toughest challenges. For Lindsey, it’s all about finding  that “aha moment.”</p>

						<p class="bio">And as the founder and main client contact for Ready Set Go, she’s focused on driving our creative goals and committed to growing our clients’ digital brands and their bottom lines.</p>

						<p class="bio bonus">Fun Fact: To say Lindsey is organized is an understatement. The girl keeps her label maker in a box labeled “Label Maker.” And we love her for it.</p>

						<p class="bio">Abbey Smith’s creative energy inspires everything she does, both professionally and personally. She’s an accomplished writer, editor, and PR manager, who has spent more than 10 years helping businesses improve their brands one headline, article, and press release at a time. And as part of the Ready Set Go team, she focuses on crafting copy that ensures our websites sound just as amazing as they look. </p>

						<p class="bio">A veteran of the advertising, public relations, and marketing worlds, Abbey says there’s a story in everything and is a pro when it comes to pinpointing clients’ messages. She believes the key to good storytelling is all about listening and uncovering the details—the bits of information that provide insight into what makes everyone’s stories unique. </p>

						<p class="bio">And because every project brings new people to meet and new subjects to learn, she knows a little on just about any topic you can imagine. In other words, she’s super accomplished when it comes to trivia night. </p>

						<p class="bio">Before launching Abbey Smith Creative, she managed the public relations department at a full-service advertising agency. In 2010, she was named as employee of the year award for her outstanding work for generating publicity for the agency’s high-profile clients.</p>

						<p class="bio bonus">Fun Fact: A little old lady at heart, she secretly (well maybe not-so-secretly now) enjoys doing crossword puzzles while watching Murder, She Wrote.</p>

						<p class="bio">What’s better than using your creativity every day to help others? Not much, according to Jay Arnold, who says being a freelancer lets him be more involved with clients and give them more tailored, one-on-one experiences. </p>

						<p class="bio">As founder and art director of Jay Arnold Creative, he brings nearly 10 years of experience to Ready Set Go and focuses on website design and wireframes, UX/UI, and overall digital branding efforts. And after receiving multiple gold and silver Addy awards, it’s obvious he’s pretty awesome at his job. </p>

						<p class="bio">Jay is integral in collaborating with our team to both share and understand clients’ unique demographics, audiences, and business goals. This allows him to create the perfect combination of intuitive design, fluidity, and content organization to meet a project’s specific needs. In other words, Jay knows what you want and how to make it happen. </p>
