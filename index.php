			<h2>Let’s get this straight: <br/>We are not your typical creative agency.</h2>

			<p>Ready Set Go is a collective of freelancers who have combined their creative talents to provide collaborative digital marketing solutions. We take a lot of pride in our work. A lot. After all, our names and reputations are on the line—so when we do something, we go for the win. </p>

			<p>And just like our setup, our entire approach to the creative process is unique. Rather than focus our work on a specific industry, service, or product, we prefer to focus on a specific type of client. That is, we specialize in working with people who aren’t afraid to rebel against tradition, who love pushing creative boundaries, and who don’t tend to use the word leverage as a verb.</p>

			<p>But we're more than creative professionals. We're also business owners and entrepreneurs who understand the responsibilities and challenges that come with owning and operating a business. </p>

			<p>So, what are you waiting for—are you in, or are you going to leverage your current resources from the sidelines?</p>

		<div class="full laptop">

			<p>It’s simple. <br/>We want you to be so stoked about our services that you tell your friends how amazing we are. After all, you wouldn’t put your stamp of approval on just anything, <br/>right?</p>
