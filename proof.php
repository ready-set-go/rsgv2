				<p>To ANYONE who wants a first-class website and/or custom graphic design:</p>

				<p>I’ve had more than 20 websites developed for a myriad of companies over the years. These experiences have ranged from good to literal nightmares. I only wish I had found Ready Set Go long ago!</p>

				<p>RSG not only made our most recent project affordable, they made it practically effortless for us while incorporating the essence of our ideas. They also brought their own incredibly imaginative and creative ideas, which none of my partners would have remotely considered. It made the end product so much more than we could have ever hoped for. It is truly unique in its look, feel, and functionality.</p>

				<p>In fact, that was one of the biggest pickups! Not only is our website inviting and engaging, but it also has back-end functionality that enables us to eliminate dated software. As a result, we are able to use our time and effort more effectively. We can now manage our client information in ways that go from lead generation all the way through emailing birthday cards. We can post pictures from our clients’ trips, and we even have the ability to allow clients to order prints from us, which provides us with additional revenue opportunities.</p>

				<p>The information and imagination provided by RSG helped our team find ways to increase revenue potential per client while simultaneously allowing us to create stronger, more meaningful relationships with our clients.</p>

				<p>Add to this the fact that RSG designed a new logo for our brand. They not only encapsulated my feelings in the logo, but they also expanded on the original concept by adding unique touches that stick in our clients’ minds. Their logo design is so strong that people who haven’t even visited us are buying our branded clothing simply because they love our logo!</p>

				<p>We’ve worked hard to upgrade our business, and RSG dedicated themselves to becoming part of our dream. And it showed with every interaction I had with them.</p>

				<p>If this all sounds "too good to be true,” think again. It comes from an incredible experience when the best before had only been “a bit better than okay.” If anyone ever wants to get the Best.... LOOK NO FURTHER!</p>

				<p><span itemprop="review">I contacted Ready Set Go in a desperate situation as the design company who created our website went out of business leaving us with no site support and a hosting company holding our site hostage. RSG members were the ultimate pros. They jumped right in and were able to secure the rights back to our website. In addition, they updated and streamlined our site with a creative edge that completely captured our business style. Amazingly, they did all of this in just a few days! Followup support has been a breeze too. I would highly recommend Ready Set Go and their services.</span></p>

				<p><span itemprop="review">We've hired Ready Set Go for several projects over the years. Each time, I must say that the experience has been a positive one. The team’s ability to decipher our needs, make suggestions, and attention to detail is quite refreshing. I can't remember a time when they didn't finish a project within the timeline... They make projects easy!</span></p>
